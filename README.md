# Two Digital Penguins - Final Assignment for MTM6201

## Project Overview
This project is the final assignment for the MTM6201 course. The website, titled "Two Digital Penguins," showcases a portfolio and services related to graphic design, branding, web design, and print media. The site was developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and other web technologies while ensuring it adheres to accessibility standards.

## Process and Challenges

### 1. Planning and Design
- **Initial Concept**: The website's design was inspired by my passion for penguins and digital design. I started by sketching out a mockup and deciding on the color scheme and layout.
- **Mockup**: A mockup was created in UX Design class to guide the development process and ensure a cohesive design.

### 2. Development
- **HTML & CSS**: The website structure was built using semantic HTML5 elements, and CSS was applied for styling. I made use of CSS variables to customize the default Bootstrap color scheme.
- **Bootstrap Framework**: The Bootstrap framework was utilized to ensure a responsive and mobile-friendly design. The grid system was particularly helpful in aligning elements across different screen sizes.
- **Accessibility**: ARIA roles, schema, and alt attributes were included to improve accessibility. I also focused on making the site fully navigable via keyboard.

### 3. Challenges
- **Responsive Design**: I tried the website looked good across different screen sizes but was challenging. I overcame this by thoroughly testing and adjusting the CSS, particularly the flexbox and grid layouts.
- **Hover Effects**: There was an issue with hover effects not working on certain elements. This was resolved by correctly structuring the HTML and ensuring that all elements were properly nested and styled.
- **Alignment Issues**: Aligning the menu and other elements required precise use of Bootstrap classes and custom CSS. I used the `d-flex` and `justify-content-between` classes in conjunction with custom margin and padding adjustments.

### 4. Learning Outcomes
- **Enhanced CSS Skills**: I learned how to effectively use CSS variables, flexbox, and grid to create a responsive design.
- **Bootstrap Proficiency**: The project deepened my understanding of Bootstrap, especially in customizing components to fit a unique design.
- **Accessibility Awareness**: I gained valuable insights into web accessibility and how to implement ARIA roles and schema to enhance user experience for everyone.

I still have a lot to learn. But practicing and researching I think I'm goin to make it and be better that now.
